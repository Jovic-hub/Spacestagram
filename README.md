## Development

### Fetch data from NASA’s APIs
To fetch data from Nasa's API, I am using Axios that is a promise-based HTTP client that facilitates to use API, basically works doing HTTP requests to fetch data, so we can display all in the information on the screen.

<br><br>The NASA_KEY is coming from a .env file, and the params are:<br>
<b>thumbs:</b> If the content type is a video from youtube, we can get just the Thumbnail url.<br>
start_date: Today date -10 days converted to YYYY-MM-DD<br>
end_date: Today date converted to YYYY-MM-DD.<br>
After getting the data from a specific range, we need to revert the order of the result, for the user see the most recent posts first.<br>

After this, we should be able do the API pagination, to get a limited amount of data from the API, this is important for some reasons:<br>
-Don't over request data from the API;<br>
-Don't force the user wait too much for all the requests;<br>
-Infinite scroll possibility.
<br><br>
For the <b>Infinite scroll</b>, I am using a open-source library for ReactJS called InfiniteScroll.<br>

<br>Data.lenght will be updated everytime that we do a new request, ManipulatePosts is doing more requests based onde the last start_date request.<br><br>

### Responsive Design
The spacestagram is completely responsive, designed first in the mobile version, than transferred to the desktop size screen.<br>
