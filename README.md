## Development

### Fetch data from NASA’s APIs
To fetch data from Nasa's API, I am using Axios that is a promise-based HTTP client that facilitates to use API, basically works doing HTTP requests to fetch data, so we can display all in the information on the screen.

The NASA_KEY is coming from a .env file, and the params are:
thumbs: If the content type is a video from youtube, we can get just the Thumbnail url.
start_date: Today date -10 days converted to YYYY-MM-DD
end_date: Today date converted to YYYY-MM-DD.
After getting the data from a specific range, we need to revert the order of the result, for the user see the most recent posts first.
